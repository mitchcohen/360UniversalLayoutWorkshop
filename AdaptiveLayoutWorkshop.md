## introducing Adaptive Layout

- Abstracts layout away from device specifics
- Introducing concept of size classes
- Available in iOS 8
- Fully supported in Xcode and IB

---
# "amount of space available for content"

## Approach to adaptive layout

1. Build base layout
2. Choose size class override
3. Uninstall irrelevant constraints
4. Add new constraints specific to size class
5. Rinse and repeat
